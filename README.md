# Daily-Codes
I am updating my daily normal coding for future preferance
It's not any project or something. I'm just updating my daily work and practice as I also able to learn quickly the git codes. :)

This is the codespace for coding this repositorie.

# Renameing the output file
	`gcc helloworld.c` will give you a.exe
	If we use `gcc -o hello helloworld.c`
	It will give you `hello` file
# Execute of multiple file
	If we have multiple code file, that takes referece from external code.
	We can execute bothe in single output.
	Like, if we have `file1.c` and `file2.c`
	then, `gcc -o file3 file1.c file2.c`
	the output file will be `file3`
